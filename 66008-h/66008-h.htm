<p class="c">AUTHOR’S NOTE</p>

<p class="nind">Palomar Mountain is one of the
grandest natural attractions of Southern
California. It is more than a mile in
height. From its lofty “look-outs”
the beautiful bay of San Diego may
be descried, and also the distant
islands of Santa Catalina and San
Clemente. It abounds with gushing
springs, richly timbered table-lands,
deep, rocky canyons, and rugged peaks.
It is one of the favorite resorts of the
writer, who has spent many pleasant
hours in camp near the mysterious
hidden cabin above the “snow white
clouds,” in company with his friend,
the Rev. John L. Pitner, D. D., to
whom these lines are inscribed.</p>

<span class="i0">So stands in majesty this mountain grand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between the desert and the western sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From ocean’s heaving breast, she upward sent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A humid vapor, in the skies to meet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And woo the softer breezes that ascend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From off the heated earth at eventide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A gentle zephyr was at play among<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And floating upward in the milky way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She met and wed the vapor from the sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For each had found a true affinity.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moon withdrew and hid her face behind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The distant isles; and from the blushing east<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A ray of sunlight came and kissed the bride.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And often as the evening twilight falls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or dewy morning sheds her purple tints,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They come and spread it over Palomar.<br /></span>

<span class="i4">Classmates were Cedric Vaughn and Homer Lee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cedric from the southland came, and in his<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Veins there flowed&mdash;tho’ mixed with Anglo-Saxon&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A trace of Montezuma blood, the same<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As that of those who met with sharpened steel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hosts of Cortez on the bloody plains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Otumba. In the lightsome morning<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his happy youth, he saw that twain who<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave him life and love, with all his kindred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By savage hands <i>struck down</i>! struck down and flung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the blazing ruins of their home.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With superhuman strength he stood beside<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His father ’till he fell; and then fought on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like wounded tiger, grimly courting death.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Filled with pagan superstition, that wild<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Robber chief&mdash;when he saw brave Cedric’s blade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cleave skull and flesh, and break like slender reeds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spears of those who came upon him three<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_15" id="page_15">{15}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To one&mdash;thought him protected by the gods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made immune to blows of mortal hands;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stricken with fear lest in revengeful wrath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They turn on him, fell on his spear and died.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the others fled and Cedric’s life was<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spared. He, wand’ring aimless o’er the waste<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce knowing where his footsteps led, came where<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Terraced hills sloped to a narrow harbor.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He knew the place and knew his father had<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Been well known there and much respected for<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair dealing, when in trade he bought and sold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not many days before, they together<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had come down this dusty trail and returned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With family stores. Sadly he walked on, his<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor heart bleeding at remembrance of those<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Happy hours now gone, when suddenly he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came upon the spot where they had rested<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By a spring and led their horses down;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here lay the branch his father’s hand had used<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To urge the horses on; and half trodden<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the mold, and scattered round, the paper<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which he had seen his mother’s loving hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wrap ’round the food prepared by her for them.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, for the first, he realized his loss.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_16" id="page_16">{16}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Upon the cold, damp bosom of the earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He laid his head and wept&mdash;alone! Beneath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bending skies and sighing boughs; no loving<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hand upon his brow; no ear to hear the<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Groans that shook his iron frame; nor knew he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How near in that dark hour the heart of Him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who suffered in the garden all alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was bending down to his. The soul may weep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still the flesh demand its own: Too proud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To eat the bread of charity, he sought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And found employment in the mines. He worked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With heavy heart, crushed for a time by dark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Despair; and giving way to hunger for<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Revenge, he well-nigh fell; but when at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A kindly light broke thro’ the gloom of his<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Black night of grief, and he could say, “Thy will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be done”; in him awoke new life and hope<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And high resolve to make of his own life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A memorial to them; and to strive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To reach the measure of their highest hope.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To this end he hoarded all his earnings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with the salvage from the wreck of their<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Estate, went bravely forth, determined to<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fulfill their wish so oft expres’d that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_17" id="page_17">{17}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might go away to school&mdash;they named the school&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i4">Homer Lee was born and reared upon the<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sacred ground where beacon lights were kindl’d<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the hills, before the war that broke the<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chains of monarchy and set this nation<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Free. His father owned ships and lands and<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Merchandise; and the son&mdash;the eldest born&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had never known a wish ungratified.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Albeit, he was not puffed up, or vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or churlish by over-much indulgence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he was nurtured in the Quaker faith,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And early taught to draw the line ’twixt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Right and wrong; and measure men by what<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They <i>are</i> and not by what they <i>have or say</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Unlike in all respects were Cedric Vaughn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Homer Lee, save in those noble traits<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of character which make men strong and brave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And true. Homer, lighter built and younger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_18" id="page_18">{18}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But noted for his prowess&mdash;when he met<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tall, dark, princely stranger from the south,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As by the power of some magnetic chain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was strangely drawn to him. Touched by the kind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Demeanor of this fair-haired, happy youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cedric’s heart went out to him. So, as the<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Years went by, between them grew a friendship<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strong as that of Pythias and his friend.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Health upon her cheek, and tint with deeper<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gold her ample braids; in purity of<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thought and loyalty, they also were alike.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Lola’s mother died when she was young, and<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her father, bringing home a Creole wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unwittingly neglected her; and thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His duty done when he provided for<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The child a nurse&mdash;an aged Octoroon&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pious soul, who gave to Lola all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The love she knew in her sweet childhood life;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And filled the tender mind with holy thoughts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pure. And Lola daily gathered flowers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, weeping, laid them on her mother’s grave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When she was older grown, her father took<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her to the north, she and her faithful nurse,<br /></span>

<span class="i4">Thus it chanced to come about that Cedric<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With all the fervor of his sincere soul&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Homer worship’d her, forgetting for<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The time his own betrothed. Cedric told her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All, she sitting by his side in shady<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bower, upon a wooded isle, their boat drawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up below upon the pebbly beach. He<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Told the story of his life, as one a<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Painful duty would perform. “She must know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The truth.” And keeping nothing back, he told<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her of his birth and lineage&mdash;which was<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Equal to her own&mdash;his loss of home and<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wealth; his lofty aspirations; high hopes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now partly realized, though penniless;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he was going back to that same land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where he had delved; and there would he employ<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The knowledge gained of placer, drift and ledge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And engineering, to locate and bring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth rich treasure from the earth, and in a<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Few short years would he return with wealth and<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Build a costly home for her in some great<br /></span>
<span class="i0">City,&mdash;she might name the place. “Could she love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him? Would she wait for him?” She answered not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By spoken word, but when she lifted her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fond eyes to his, he read the sweet response.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_22" id="page_22">{22}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">By his strong arms encircled tenderly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her head upon his breast, she wept for joy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And speaking through her tears: “Oh, leave me not,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But let me share your lot whate’er it be&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A palace or a cot&mdash;I would leave all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world, my Cedric, dear, and go with thee.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Cedric kindly told her of the place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its roughness, the peons there; and frankly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But perhaps unwise, he spoke of dangers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the wild bandits. It was no place for<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One so sweet and gentle as his own dear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lola; it were better she obey her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Father’s call. That day, a week, the ship that<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He expected her to take, would leave that<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Port. It would not be long; he would stop there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On his way and see her father, speak to<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him, as man to man should speak, all fair and<br /></span>
<span class="i0">honorable. The wisdom of his speech<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She saw and cheerful yielded to his will.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fervid kiss their pledges sealed, they sat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sweet converse till lengthening shadows called;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then spread their sail and shoreward set the prow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of their light craft. With rosy finger tips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She swept the strings of her guitar and sang:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_23" id="page_23">{23}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">In heavenly bliss.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">At some port discharging<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Freightage, the ship would often linger for<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A day, and those on board would wander thro’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The town. Once they saw a vessel that plied<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between that southern coast and Africa<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unload its cargo&mdash;human souls, who had<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Been stolen from their home and brought to this<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Free country to be sold to servitude.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Haughty. He had hinted at a union<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">He kissed away her tears and playfully<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His desire; but that high sense of honor,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Mastery over self. And from that hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He never knew a thought of selfishness.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He soothed her fears; and by words of wisdom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(As before) soon brought her judgment into<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet accord with his. But it was agreed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That if her father answered his request<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With scorn, or treated him unkindly, there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would be no angry words. That he would go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And never ask again. When he returned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would take her as his rightful own; and then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He held her to his breast, and laid upon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her lips what they both well knew might be his<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Farewell kiss. For even then they saw her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Father’s carriage coming up the drive. When<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They met and she presented her betrothed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cedric recognized the man who bought the<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slave and would have torn the infant from its<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mother’s breast. Yet, speaking calmly, told him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who he was, whence and why he came; told all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Manfully; and the Colonel heard him thro’.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Then, with derisive laugh, he taunted him<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_30" id="page_30">{30}</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Property in land or slaves.” The hot blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rushing to his brow, he boldly answered:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“I go, accepting these conditions, but<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surely will return.” Then, taking Lola’s<br /></span>

<span class="i0">All in line. They moved by easy stages,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stopping often in some shady dell to<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To buy and till the soil, some to obey<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The inborn instinct of the pioneer.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A quaint old hacienda of the Dons;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With many leagues of land that lay between<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Came that secret terror of his life,&mdash;he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spoke unlike himself&mdash;severe, unkindly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“She obeys her father’s will and he would<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will that she remain unseen, unknown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To strange intruder. The young man makes bold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In asking.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">Answered Gilbert, manfully:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“May not a true heart be emboldened by<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_62" id="page_62">{62}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hope of winning one so beautiful?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The asking honorable? Perchance the<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Señor has himself in days gone by made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like request?” Spoke of his family<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old and honored, lived on the Gilbert rancho<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the valley. Would he offer them rebuke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unwittingly? Cedric by his words the<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More determined they should never meet, for<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Zola’s sake and his, resolved to flee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With her, so spoke deceitfully. He must<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go and wait six days and on the seventh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come; if she were there then he might speak with<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her. Gilbert said respectfully: “<span class="lftspc">’</span>Tis well!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With such a hope I well may add to my<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long waiting one more week.” And with a smile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of hopefulness, he rode away. Cedric<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pitying, watched him disappear among<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ceanothus bloom and drooping boughs.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Zola coming, on her face the look of<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sadness,&mdash;signs of weeping,&mdash;Cedric knowing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now the secret of the change in her&mdash;the<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Absence of the rippling laughter noticed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the months gone by&mdash;his kind heart melted<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_63" id="page_63">{63}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And well-nigh did he repent and tell her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All, tell Gilbert; but the specter haunting<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fixed his purpose; she must go or face a<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deeper sorrow. So, despite his feeling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smilingly and cheerful, told her they would<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go and sail across the ocean&mdash;sail to<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Foreign lands. Thus seeking to beguile and<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turn her from the tie that bound her heart to<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Palomar, spake he of the people and<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sights that they would see. Long had they<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remained in Nature’s parlor; now going,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would they view the halls and palaces of<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Splendor they had read about. She smiling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sadly, kissed and thanked him for his kindness.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">She daily strolled where she had seen the face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Gilbert, vainly waiting with the hope<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he would come once more&mdash;pensively, with<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tears&mdash;and prayed that she might see him once<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again before she went away. The sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From out its saffron-tinted bed burst forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kissed the mountain peaks. She weeping, heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The matin song of birds and cooing doves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The melody of Nature’s minstrelsy<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_64" id="page_64">{64}</a></span>&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard, and yet not heard, for today must she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Decide among her treasures, which to take<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And which to leave behind. Came Zimbo and<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her pets for breakfast from her hand, the last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But one, for early on the morrow she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would go. “Shall we never come again to<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This dear spot?” she asked. Cedric feigning<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cheerfulness, his sadness ill-concealed,&mdash;ran<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On assuringly: “Of course, we will return<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rest from our long journey ’round the world;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, bring your bric-a-brac, my girl, and we<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will pack it snugly in the cabin, bar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The doors and leave all safe and sound. We may<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Find Zimbo and the other pets all waiting<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When we come. Cheer up, my darling; dry your<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tears, for wondrous sights are waiting for those<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eyes to feast upon.” Thus talking, while he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Packed her treasures in the hidden cabin.<br /></span>

<span class="i4">Gilbert, sleepless, counted yet the slowly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dragging hours&mdash;three more days, and then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The promised one; pondered o’er the words of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_65" id="page_65">{65}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That strange man on Palomar,&mdash;words so oft<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Speak with her.” “<i>If she be here!</i>” Their meaning&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His intention&mdash;dawned upon him. “She will<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Not be there!</i>” In frantic haste he rose and<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Threw his saddle on his fastest horse and<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sent the spurs along his quivering flanks;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His adolescent blood in angry throbs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His eyes ablaze, he wildly flew across<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mesa, through the foothills, brave Bonita<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stag’ring, bore him up the trail. In early<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Morning came to where he spoke with Cedric.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">On the slope he saw the tethered burros,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well-filled packs and camping equipage near<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By. Then from the curtained maze of trailing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vines and boughs, he heard the gurgling waters<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the spring and sound of axe. Pressing thro’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He came upon the hidden cabin, Cedric<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Placing bars before the door, and Zola<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By his side. At sight of him came bounding<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Zimbo, stop’d by Zola’s voice. Then, with head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uncovered&mdash;bowed, as one in reverential<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Attitude before a shrine&mdash;addressed her:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_66" id="page_66">{66}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">“We have been acquainted long, if not by<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spoken word, then by the cords that bind two<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hearts as one. This man who calls you daughter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He may tell you of his promise&mdash;explain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The breaking&mdash;doubting not his motive, I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Believe him kind and true.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">“<i>Calls you daughter!</i>”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smote poor Cedric’s soul; a deadly pallor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swept across his kindly face. The time had<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come when he must speak&mdash;must tell the secret<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his life&mdash;her life. Then he recited<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All that he remembered,&mdash;Zola’s unknown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Parentage; his stealing her, and fear that<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She be taken; how he had suffered with<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dread of making known to her that he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was not her father. Speaking, the strong man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breaking, wept. Her love and true devotion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Setting all aside, she sprang to him and<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clinging, cried: “<i>He is my own dear father!</i>”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her dazzling beauty now intensified.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">As one enchanted, Gilbert looked upon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The scene; such filial love revealed a depth<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_67" id="page_67">{67}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of soul beyond his ken; thought he of those<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who called him son&mdash;what they had done for him&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of the promise he had made to them.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes, he would die for them; yet in their pride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of name and family might they not spurn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This nameless one? Thus in the balance weighed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His love for her was satisfied; fortune,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Name and family were all as naught to<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him compared with Zola. He proudly asked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again to woo the hermit’s daughter and<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Winning, give to her his name.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">“No, no,” she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Answered for the father, “until this cloud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is lifted&mdash;mystery solved&mdash;my name is<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Zola Vaughn.” With her words, a light broke in<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Gilbert. Joyously he spoke; as he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had promised would he go back to the states<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seek a bride, solve the mystery and<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Return triumphant, claim her&mdash;his Zola&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As his bride. Would take the ship now in<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The harbor, sail tomorrow. Cedric gave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The name of Colonel Vail, but his memory<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yielded meagerly of information<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_68" id="page_68">{68}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Needed. He well remembered all his life<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Up to</i> the day that he left Lola at<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her father’s home, and <i>from</i> the day she died,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gap between in mystery wrapt, all blank.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gilbert, taking Cedric’s hand, said: “From this<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Day your life shall be a pattern for my<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Own. God bless you.” And to Zola: “You are<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mine whate’er my journey may reveal;” and<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unmindful of her sweet rebuke, he held<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her to his breast and kissed her. That life-long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fear for her still haunting, Cedric followed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him aside and whispered: “The father, if<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He be found, pray name her not to him.” From<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mountain top she watched him out of sight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, alone on Palomar, the hermit’s<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Daughter wept.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">When their only son went forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To seek a bride&mdash;to keep his vow&mdash;there was<br /></span>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">After journey long and wearisome, he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reached the Crescent City and the home of<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Colonel Vail. The aged man now mellowed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By weight of years, remorseful, mourning<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And alone, received him kindly, answered:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Her father’s name was Simon Blake, he was<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Murdered by a Mexican upon the<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dock. The child, my grandchild’s name was Blake.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The man who loved my daughter came and found her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dying. ’Twas he who took the child away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they were lost at sea.” Gilbert had the<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Story of her life&mdash;her name was Zola<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blake.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">With heavy heart he homeward turned, yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No less loyal to his Zola. With sad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Misgivings waited for the coming of<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ship&mdash;long overdue&mdash;by stormy sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kept back. Waiting, pondered gloomily; he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must go and bear the tidings that would solve<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mystery of her name, but leave a<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Darker shadow than before. Still would she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Refuse his name they would go away from<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_70" id="page_70">{70}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Palomar. They at the rancho, left so<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Happily, what would he say to them? At<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Last with tattered sail and broken, came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ship. He hastening, learned that it would<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay at anchor there yet two days more in<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mending. Hopeless, yet with strange desire to<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Linger there, again he visited the<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hospital where Zola’s mother died; but<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As before, no voice could answer aught of<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her; yet caught a thread of hope&mdash;an aged<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Priest in near-by parish <i>might</i> remember.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">The father heard him,&mdash;listened eagerly;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then in his book of records found the date<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Lola Vail and Cedric Vaughn were wed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the christening of her daughter&mdash;their child.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Left with him for Cedric, left by Lola,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The treasure he had brought from Mexico,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lola’s diary, presents he had given,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a miniature of Cedric done by<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her own hand; then to the house where they were<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Married and her resting place. Gilbert took<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The proof to Colonel Vail and together<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They rejoiced. He begged that he would bring his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_71" id="page_71">{71}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grandchild there when they were wed, and Cedric<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vaughn, that he might grasp the hand of that true<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Man. Now, to Gilbert’s happy heart attuned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By hope’s fruition, Nature brought a new<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glad song. The bird notes rang with sweeter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Melody&mdash;sunshine brighter&mdash;bluer skies&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even in the tumbling troughs of ocean’s<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Depth, he read the mirrored light of love and<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Joy. Thro’ long and dreary days beneath a<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tropic sun,&mdash;in calm, or fog, or buffeted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By winds adverse, the good ship sped ’til thro’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mild Pacific’s purple haze, Point<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loma came in view and then, across the<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mesa, to the hacienda, <i>home again</i>.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">With mysterious air, and teasing told,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or partly told the story. Yes; he had<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Found a fairy queen and when again the<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great round moon came o’er the mountain top, she,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Riding on its silvery beams, would come in<br /></span>
<span class="i0">State,&mdash;would come with him&mdash;come to the rancho.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They must “<span class="lftspc">’</span>bide-a-wee” and trusting him, wait<br /></span>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
